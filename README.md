# How to Angular
My way to learn Angular

I'll learn Angular with tutorials or lectures and will probably make a list about my experiences.

# Steps

## 1st step - YouTube Tutorial:
- [Learn Angular 8 from Scratch for Beginners - Crash Course](https://youtu.be/_TLhUCjY9iA) by DesignCourse.
- Gives a short overview but I can't recommend since I didn't get a good understanding of Angular but then again, perhaps just me.

## 2nd step - YouTube Tutorial:
- [Angular - Build a Budget Calculator Application](https://youtu.be/sU4z4Ti-8OQ) by Devstackr.
- I can recommend. It shows Angular while programming an application and I really enjoyed it.
- I created a repository for it, you can find it [here](https://github.com/GKohs/Angular-BudgetApp) and you can see the end result [here](https://gkohs.github.io/Angular-BudgetApp/).
